                <h1>VolumeWizard:Gesture-Driven Sound Mastery</h1><a href="https://github.com/kashishsinghal13/VolumeWizard-Gesture-Driven-Sound-Mastery.git" target="_blank">Link</a>

                    <h3>Overview:</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project focuses on developing a novel volume controller and brightness adjustment system using hand gestures as input. Leveraging the OpenCV module, a webcam captures and interprets gestures, regulating the system's volume and brightness accordingly. The primary aim is to offer an intuitive and non-verbal means of controlling essential computer functions, eliminating the need for conventional input devices.
                    </p>

                <h1>KAAS-Umbrella</h1><a href="https://github.com/kashishsinghal13/KAAS-Umbrella.git" target="_blank">Link</a>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Nowadays due to changing climatic conditions it's hard to predict the weather conditions. Given such unpredictable weather it’s hard to take precautions every day. We have to carry an umbrella always irrespective of the weather. Carrying it in hand every time is also a problem. This problem is for students and working people, who constantly need to engage themselves with mobile devices. So, there is a need of an automatic umbrella which doesn’t required to be held in hands. So that anyone who wants to works or use their mobile device even in rain, it shouldn’t be a problem.

                    The objective of our project is to help all the students, working people by making an handsfree umbrella with which they don’t have to worry about the weather and can effortlessly use their mobile devices even while walking in rain. Our project can turn your ordinary bag into a hybrid bag by having an umbrella attached to it. So, when ever rain starts just with push of a button the umbrella, which initially rests on the bag, opens up and protects us from the rain and also leaving our hands to do any work. Since ages we have been using the traditional umbrella which needs to be held in hand, which only protects the one under it and fails to protect his/her accessories from rain, and also restricts our hand to doing only one job i.e., holding the umbrella. But these problems won’t be anymore because with our project i.e., KAAS UMBRELLA, there is no need of catching it without hand which makes our hand restriction free, and also protects the person under it along with the accessories. These all can be done with an ease of just clicking a button. Moreover, we can also use this even if it’s not raining, to protect ourselves from the sun. this project comes in handy for all the seasons. In winter – to protect ourselves from snow, in summer – to protect ourselves from sun, in rain – to protect ourselves from rain.</p>

                <h1>Entertainment Based Toys (Elephant)</h1><a href="https://github.com/kashishsinghal13/elephant_toy.git" target="_blank">Link</a>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    A toy manufacturing industry in the town is interested in designing of toys for entertaining the kids. There is need of designing an elephant model which should be semi-automatic, should move as slow as possible, and serve the purpose of entertainment and attract kids with its appearance. The cost of the toy should be less than 2500.and it should move as slow as possible. The remote control basically consists of two types, one is the wired and another one is the wireless. The wired component consists of remote control which can easily control the movements and the wireless component consists of receiving and detecting sensors and performing actions accordingly. My project is specially for the small children’s, so that they can play . This smart toy performs walking movement. The goal of this project is to design a toy elephant for entertainment.
                </p>
                <h3>Main objectives of this project are:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The toy should move as slow as possible.</li>
                    <li>As this toy is for children (3-6 years) it should be easy to operate.</li>
                    <li>Appearance of the toy should be good, then only children likes it to play</li>
                    <li>Cost of the toy should not exceed 2500Rs.</li>
                    <li>Body of the toy should be much rigid.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Firstly, a code with required operations including ultrasonic sensor and Bluetooth module with switch operation is uploaded into micro-controller (Arduino). L293D Motor driver shield is attached to Arduino board and wheels using shafts are attached to the motor driver using wires. Bluetooth module sent the signal to the Arduino board and wheels starts rotating. Hence the elephant toy starts moving. We can operate it manually by using ultra sonic sensor. Ultra sonic sensor is kept at the front of the toy. If ultrasonic sensor detects any object (obstacle) then it will change toy’s direction.
